Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-known for their ability to understand and generate language, making them a promising tool for improving English Language Studies and Teaching. However, there are important challenges to consider, such as concerns about honesty in academic work, overestimating what LLMs can do, and difficulties in making them accessible to everyone.
Understanding Large Language Models in Education
Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence technology, particularly in their ability to process and generate human-like text.
